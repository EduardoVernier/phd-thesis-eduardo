  abstract = {Simultaneous dynamic profiling of mRNA and protein expression is increasingly popular, and there is a critical need for algorithms to identify regulatory layers and time dependency of gene expression. A group of scientists from United States and Singapore present PECAplus, a comprehensive set of statistical analysis tools to address this challenge. Protein expression control analysis (PECA) computes the probability scores for change in mRNA and protein-level regulatory parameters at each time point, deconvoluting gene expression regulation in the presence of measurement noise. PECAplus adapted PECA's mass action model to a variety of proteomic data including pulsed SILAC and generic protein expression data. It also features analysis modules to fit smooth curves on rugged time series observations, and to facilitate time-dependent interpretation of the data for genes and biological functions. ?They demonstrate the core modules with two time course datasets of mammalian cells responding to unfolded proteins and pathogens.},

For a sample of U.S. firms, the magnitude of FX exposure appears to increase during periods of low currency risk diversifiability. Additional results suggest that the introduction of the euro exacerbated the effect of diversifiability on developed market currency exposure. Moreover, the low diversifiability of emerging market currencies seems to have a stronger effect on FX exposure than the low diversifiability of developed market currencies.}

  abstract = {Sequential analysis of medical time series has important implications when data concern vital functions of the human body. Traditional monitoring of vital signs is performed by comparing the level of time series with predetermined target bands. As in industrial control charts, alarm signals start when the series level goes beyond the bands. Many physiological time series, however, are non-stationary with stochastic cycles and are characterized by turning points, i.e. periods where the slope of the series changes sign and determines the beginning of rise and fall phases. Turning points are useful indicators of the effect of drugs and medications and must be timely detected in order to calibrate the drug dosage or perform interventions. Sequential and recursive filters are suitable methods for change and turning points; they are mainly given by double exponential smoothing, time-varying parameter regression and prediction error statistics. Their tuning coefficients can be selected in a data-driven way, by optimizing score functions based on the series’ oscillation. Extensive application to real and simulated data shows that adaptive techniques represent effective solutions to on-line monitoring and surveillance in medicine.11Data and Matlab software are provided in the supplementary material.}
