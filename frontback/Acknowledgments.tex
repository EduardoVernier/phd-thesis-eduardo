I would like to thank my advisors Prof. Alexandru Telea and Prof. Jo\~{a}o Comba for all the support and guidance they so skillfully and kindly provided me during my PhD. I couldn't possibly imagine better companions for this journey.

I would like to thank my family for their love, their patience, their inspiration, and for always providing me all I've ever needed to succeed.

I would also like to thank all my friends both in Brazil and in the Netherlands. Krislen, Lianne, Alister, Samuel, and Agathe, thank you for lifting me up whenever I was down.
