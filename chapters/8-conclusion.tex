\chapter{Conclusion}


% -we examined the evaluation and improvement of viz algos for abstract dynamic data.
% -we considered 2 main instances of this data: hierarchies and high-dim datasets.
% -in both cases, we found out that quality can be described by two main criteria: vis quality and stability
% -in both cases, for vis quality, we could reuse existing metrics from vizzes for static data of those types
% -in both cases, for stability, there was nothing; we could propose new metrics for that, which are interestingly almost the SAME for the 2 kinds of data; they basically measure the DERIVATIVE of the visualization function (how much the vis changes when the data changes that much)
% -in both cases, we found that the 2 qual criteria are multually competing; also, we did benchmarks, and found thereâ€™s no clear winner in the existing algos; some optimize vis qual but thrash stability, some the other way round, some are kind of in the middle
% -in both cases, we proposed improvements to existing algos which overall increased BOTH qual metrics (vis qual, stability)

% Then, of course, you can add something in this section concerning

% -limitations: feel free to say what could have been done better ðŸ˜Š
% -future work: feel free to speculate here too ðŸ˜Š
% [I can of course suggest a lot here, but I donâ€™t want to monopolize the writing]

% Anyways, the conclusion should be like 3-4 pages, not more.
